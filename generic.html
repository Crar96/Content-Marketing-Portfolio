								<p>My experience working as a Content Marketing Manager has allowed me to become highly proficient in the production and ideation of original content, including E-books, landing pages, 
									white papers, blogs, and executive reports. I also acted as the principle sub-editor at Ogury, carefully reviewing all corporate-facing and digital materials to ensure they adhere to the company branding and postioning. 
									My skills go beyond just copywriting; after becoming enthralled with the tech world, I made it my duty to upskill and add more technical abilities to my repertoire.</p>
									<p>I thoroughly enjoy marketing automation, with my software of choice being Adobe Marketo Engage. In November 2023, I also began a bootcamp in Front-end development and put those skills to use
									in the creation and hosting of this website.
